            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Kilimanjaro climb</h1><p>When people heard about my
summer adventure in Tanzania, they asked if I was scared to climb the mountain.
“Are you ready? Is it hard? Aren’t you scared?” they would rattle off as I
chuckled to myself. I would sort of smile, and reply, “I’m pretty excited, but
I am afraid of heights.” Most people looked pretty confused after I told them I
barely made it to the second level of the Eiffel Tower when I was eight years
old or that my freshman year of college I couldn’t walk across the Golden Gate
Bridge without two people as buffers to the outer edge, but now I was
climbing the tallest mountain in Africa?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9df9ce4f0ca5bed330243e3b9c062c855f8138c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>National parks ride</h1><p>In September, I accompanied two clients from Switzerland, Reza and Nathalie on the newest SENE adventure, a multi-day walk in the Kilimanjaro foothills. This trip took 4 days walking from Mweka Village, just up the mountain from Moshi, to SENE’s Mbahe cottages, 46 kilometers by foot and many ridges and valleys to the west, along ancient Chagga footpaths threaded between the national park forest and local villages.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/12979388f121c488fba21a075617af3c42b19f55.jpg"></article>]]></description>
