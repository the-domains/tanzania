            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Kilimanjaro climb</h1><p>When people heard about my
summer adventure in Tanzania, they asked if I was scared to climb the mountain.
“Are you ready? Is it hard? Aren’t you scared?” they would rattle off as I
chuckled to myself. I would sort of smile, and reply, “I’m pretty excited, but
I am afraid of heights.” Most people looked pretty confused after I told them I
barely made it to the second level of the Eiffel Tower when I was eight years
old or that my freshman year of college I couldn’t walk across the Golden Gate
Bridge without two people as buffers to the outer edge, but now I was
climbing the tallest mountain in Africa?</p></article>]]></description>
