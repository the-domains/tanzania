# National parks ride

In September, I accompanied two clients from Switzerland, Reza and Nathalie on the newest SENE adventure, a multi-day walk in the Kilimanjaro foothills. This trip took 4 days walking from Mweka Village, just up the mountain from Moshi, to SENE's Mbahe cottages, 46 kilometers by foot and many ridges and valleys to the west, along ancient Chagga footpaths threaded between the national park forest and local villages.

After months of preparation I was excited to finally join clients to live this experience with them.

Our guide was Manase Lyimo, whom many of you know as a SENE running guide and assistant mountain guide. As we soon learned, he is also an expert in navigating this pastoral environment of waterfalls , coffee and banana groves, maize fields, pastures, and wildflowers.

We quickly discovered that we were as much of an interest to the many children we encountered as their environment was to us. Through them we discovered the local rural life.

The bolder children would approach us and tentatively follow in our footsteps, walk with us and look at us with their big smiles. We could hear them giggling behind us as for them we speak and get dressed differently. Reza and Nathalie were always trying to engage them in conversation -- mixing English and pantomime -- to establish an interaction. Shyness and apprehension quickly melted away. The kids were always interested in our taking photos with them, but always with the promise to see the photos afterwards!
