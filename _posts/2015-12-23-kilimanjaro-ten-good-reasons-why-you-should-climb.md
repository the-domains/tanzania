# Kilimanjaro climb

When people heard about my
summer adventure in Tanzania, they asked if I was scared to climb the mountain.
"Are you ready? Is it hard? Aren't you scared?" they would rattle off as I
chuckled to myself. I would sort of smile, and reply, "I'm pretty excited, but
I am afraid of heights." Most people looked pretty confused after I told them I
barely made it to the second level of the Eiffel Tower when I was eight years
old or that my freshman year of college I couldn't walk across the Golden Gate
Bridge without two people as buffers to the outer edge, but now I was
climbing the tallest mountain in Africa?

Before
I left, I stumbled upon a quote by Seth Godin that said, "If it scares you it
might be a good thing to try." I always enjoy challenging myself, and facing
fears are sort of an ultimate challenge.

That's
never been more real to me than on the part of the hike that forces you to
scramble along a 600ft wall, known as the Great Barranco. You have to climb,
scoot, and hike up the wall and pray you don't look down and see the small
creek at the bottom.  I'm sorry to report I looked down. I immediately closed
my eyes and was suddenly certain that climbing this wall was one of
the hardest things I've had to do in my life. However, I also knew it
was all in my head. I had to contain the fear and utilize the energy to keep
climbing.

Fear,
at the end of the day, is a good thing. If you harness your fear, you can use
it to motivate, to encourage, and to prove to yourself and to others that you
don't let your fears win. Overcoming fear creates a mental
toughness that will pay dividends not only when you're trying to climb a
mountain, catch a spider in the house for your younger sister, or watch bats on
the South Congress Bridge, but also when you have to make a presentation,
confront people with issues, or carry out your own big decisions in life.
